Coding standards are often viewed as trivial details, focusing on minor errors such as indentation, or even that frustrating curly brace placement. However, I believe that these standards are more than a set of rules; they are fundamental aspect of writing clean, maintainable, executable code. If I had to choose one software engineering technique that has the most direct impact on code quality, it would be the implementation of coding standards. Even adding comments can really ensure my understanding and even help other people who are looking at my code to learn from my techniques. 

## Coding Standards as a Learning Tool  
Some people may not associate coding standards with learning a programming language, as we don’t think there’s a strong connection. When I learn a new language, I often struggle with understanding not only the syntax, but also the best practices that make the code efficient and maintainable. Coding standards provide a clear guideline for structuring code in a way that aligns with the language intended usage patters. In my experience, sticking to the standards has led to a deeper understanding of how a language is ment to be used. For example, Typesript standards has helped me ‘grasp’ its type system since its somewhat connected to Java and Javascript. Over the time, the structure imposed by the standards becomes second nature, and this has improved me overall proficiency with the language. 


## Painful, but Ultimately Useful 
One of the most important aspects of coding standards is their role in facilitating teamwork. In group projects, its important that everyone’s code looks and feels the same. It helps if everyone understands the code moreover easily, as it may results in different stylistic differences when it comes to coding. 
	
	From past group projects, adhering to coding standards helped streamline collaboration. We were able to work more efficiently because we weren’t wasting time debating over stylistic preferences or struggling to understand each other’s code. Instead, we could focus on the more critical aspects of solving the problem at hand. 
 
## Final Thoughts  
Coding standards are much more than just rules about indentation or curly brace placement. They are important part of writing high quality code that is maintainable, scalable, and easy to understand. While the process of addressing ESLint errors can feel tedious, but it is ultimately a useful tool for learning a language, improving code quality, and doing collaboration with my classmates. By embracing coding standards, I’ve learned to write cleaner, more efficient code, and I’ve found that they have become an essential part of my programming journey. 
	
	Overall my experience with ESLint have been both challenging and rewarding, and I’ve come to appreciate the value that coding standards benefit for my coding assignments. They are not just for the aesthetics—they make sure that every piece of code contributes to the bigger picture and quality.
