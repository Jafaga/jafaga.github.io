*"Yesterday was history, tommorrow is a mystery, but today is a gift" - Master Oogway*

Growing up as an "iPad kid," I’ve always been fascinated by technology. I spent a lot of time playing around with my iPad and wondering how it worked. I also found it interesting how my mom's phone could be controlled just by touch. These early experiences sparked my curiosity and got me thinking about how these devices were built, leading me to explore software engineering.

One person who really inspired me is Steve Jobs. His work with Apple and his vision for technology left a big impact on me. Jobs didn’t just create cool devices; he changed the way we interact with technology by making it simple and user-friendly. Watching his impact on the tech world made me want to dig deeper into how things like computers and phones function. His focus on pushing the boundaries and being innovative motivated me to pursue computer science in college.

When I first became interested in technology, it was all about figuring out how devices like iPads and smartphones worked. But now, after starting my studies in computer science, I realize that software engineering is about much more than just how devices function. It's about problem-solving and creating tools that can improve people's lives. One of the fields that interests me the most is artificial intelligence (AI). I find the idea of machines learning and adapting to be really exciting, and I’m eager to explore this area further.

As I move forward in my college journey, I’m working toward the goal of joining a major tech company like Apple or Microsoft. These companies have always stood out to me because they’re known for their innovation and leadership in technology. I want to be part of that, whether it’s creating new software, working on AI projects, or developing the next big thing in tech.

Overall, my journey from an "iPad kid" to a computer science student has been driven by curiosity and a desire to understand how technology works. I’m excited about what I’ve learned so far and even more excited about what’s to come. I hope to take everything I learn in college and apply it to a future in the tech industry, where I can make a difference and contribute to the innovations that shape our world.
