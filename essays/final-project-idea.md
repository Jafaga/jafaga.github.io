# Personalized Study Music Playlist 

**Proposers**: Justine Afaga & Lewin Lin 

## Overview 
**The Issue**: For many students, studying effectively can hinge on having the right environment and resources. Music can enchance focus, reduce stress, and even boost memory. However, find the right study music for each task can be hard, as one's concentration needs vary depending on the mood, study goals, and workload intensity. While some might benefit from ambient background noise, others may require specific beats or melodies to maintain focus or enter a flow state. As students from UH Manoa, we juggle from multiple academic responsibilities and we often focus a lot on studying, which having an app that simplifies and personalizes our study music can be really helpful. 

**The solution**: This project proposes a "Personalized Study Music Playlist" app that creates a playlists based on each user's study habbits, concentration level, and personal music preferences. By inputting details such as the mood, the study session's purpose (e.g., intense focus vs relaxed music), and time, users will receive a tailored playlist that is designed to enchance productivity and reduce distractions. In addition, the app will allow for adjustments depending on a user concentration needs during a learning session. 

## Mockup page ideas 
### 1) Home Screen
- The main dashboard includes the app's features and prompts users to create a playlist for their study session
- Key options include fields for study time, mood selector, and music genre preferences.

### 2) Playlist Generation Screen 
- An easy to read interface where users select their mood and study type, then view a suggested playlist with some titles, artists, and duration.
- Playlist customization options are included, such as "add more tracks" or "inlude classical background music".

### 3) Session tracker and Adjustments 
- As users study, a screen allows them to track time remaining in their session and make adjustments to the music if needed. 
- Options for "less distracting" or "more focus-enchancing" adjustments appear here to refind the playlist based on real-time feedback.

### 4) Community Sharing and Suggestions 
- Users can see what others are listening to for similar study tasks or moods.
- Popluar study playlists for UH Manoa students can be featured, fostering a community-driven approach to an effective study habit.
